1. Pick a website and describe your objective

--> Browse through different sites and pick one to scrape. 

--> Identify the information you'd like to scrape from the site. Decide the format of the output CSV file.

--> Summarize your project idea and outline your strategy in a Juptyer notebook.

2. Use the requests library to download web pages

--> Inspect the website's HTML source and identify the right URLs to download.

--> Download and save web pages locally using the requests library.

--> Create a function to automate downloading for different topics/search queries.

3. Use Beautiful Soup to parse and extract information

-->Parse and explore the structure of downloaded web pages using Beautiful soup.

-->Use the right properties and methods to extract the required information.

-->Create functions to extract from the page into lists and dictionaries.

-->(Optional) Use a REST API to acquire additional information if required.

4. Create CSV file(s) with the extracted information

--> Create functions for the end-to-end process of downloading, parsing, and saving CSVs.

-->Execute the function with different inputs to create a dataset of CSV files.

--> Verify the information in the CSV files by reading them back using Pandas.
