4. For statistics watch Krish Naik's statistics playlist
5. If you want a more structured course you can follow Mathematics for machine learning by Imperial College London on coursera
6. For machine learning :-
  - Krish Naik Machine Learning Playlist(includes math intution)
  - Codebasics Machine Learning playlist(sk learn implementation)
  - IBM Machine Learning using Python in on coursera
7. I regularly update all my resources here for specific algorithms :- https://github.com/vanshika230/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Resources.md
8. For the roadmap I follow :- https://github.com/vanshika230/Machine-Learning/blob/main/TO%20DO.txt PLEASE READ THE DISCLAIMER BEFORE FOLLOWING
